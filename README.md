# Algorithm Visualizer

This is a C++ project that visualizes various graph traversal algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and BFS. The goal is to provide a platform where users can see how these algorithms work in real-time.

## Features
- Graph creation and manipulation.
- Visualization of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, A*, and BFS.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Use a C++ compiler (like g++) to compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o algorithm_visualizer main.cpp graph.cpp dijkstra.cpp astar.cpp bfs.cpp
3. Run the executable.
   ./algorithm_visualizer
